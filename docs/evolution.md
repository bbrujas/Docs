Below are some of the next steps for the padswap ecosystem

**Governance System** (need to work on this)

**TOAD.Network Application**

The app sets forth to get TOAD in the hands of everyone that has a smartphone.
Offer Savings, auto-staking, crypto information, crypto games and on boarding millions of users that don’t have access to a desktop.
Mobile traffic is rising year after year with estimations of 90% of all web traffic by 2027 being mobile.

**Auto-compound Savings**

Why earn fractions of a 1% from your local lending institution when you could set and forget.
Earning 4-6% passive income a year, safe on the blockchain.
We feel this will provide the under-banked with a great opportunity to save like never before.
As more and more nations expand access to the free market of banking a safe yield product held with the impermeable security of smart contracts is needed more then ever.
The TOAD.Network ecosystem plans to give every being with access to a smartphone and internet a viable saving/staking option in a fair system.
True to form this will bring millions of Sats to the TOAD.Network ecosystem in fair and transparent fashion.

**NFT Marketplace**

TOAD.Network will host one beast of a marketplace.
Built by the team that brought you NBA Topshot.
TOAD sets out to distance itself in a sea of NFT options by opening up the marketplace for all users on the Binance Smart Chain.
Several featured artists are on board Combined with cross chain Bridges TOAD NFTs will be a solid option for those looking to own a part of the blockchain.
1 TOAD NFT will be auctioned for each of the 5,000 burnt upon inception.
You must hold at least 1 TOAD NFT to vote in TOADAO and governance. 

**Portfolio Tracker**

Tracking all your gains can be tedius we are devloping a one stop shop to track all stakes and performance across the entire TOAD.Network ecosystem.
This is especially crucial for navigation and knowledge of PADSwap at the time of writing already has over 10 farms and more are being added every week.
Simplifcation and streamlining are key to user retention and expansion.
This will be expanded to build datasets for autostake and be a product built to expand onto the TOAD Application.

**TOAD.Network Merchandising**

Limited series runs will continue at set intervals for the TOAD.Network X Piramyd store.
This store only accepts BUSD at this time (an easy conversion on PADSwap).
This Form store collects orders, washes transaction/wallets via the back-end to preserve identities of the users.
TOAD Plushies, phone cases, and other community suggested ideas are due for upcoming series.
The Amazon store will be up for the foreseeable future BITCOINHASHER runs and operates this and is constantly updating the store with new designs and products.
Representing TOAD is always fashionable.

**Partnerships**

All TOAD.Network Partners must establish and uphold values set forth in the foundation of TOAD.
These can be defined as being Transparent, Overtly seeking to improve cryptospace, Anti-Scam, and Determined to aquire for use.
We prefer to establish long standing relationships as TOAD.Network plans to be here in 50 years.
TOAD.Network prefers win-win scenarios that benefit all except the sad non-adopter. 

**Animated Series**

Initially set out to explain TOAD.Network’s complex framework, principals and products.
This endeavor has expanded into short form advertisements as well.
Objective here is to break down concepts while gaining user attention and retention.
Beautiful animation combined with math and memes.
Tiny morsels of truth, facts, wrapped up in the fabric of skilled visualizations.
This will not only help users discover our ecosystem, it will keep them informed of new advanced products and teach how to use them in a rewarding fashion.

**LaunchPAD**

This is the new featured service to create and release projects on the BSC, already moving from alpha to beta status, it will provide project makers with the needed tools to simply stake liquid and launch.
Modular settings will allow liquid to be locked in flash loan proof farms with variable tokenomics or rapidly launch the next shitcoin meme.
This brings a plethora of utility and market share to PADSwap by simplifying and streamlining the launch process with variable options we are empowering creators to reach markets faster, safer and with more transparency to the user.

**Crypto ATMs**

TOAD will be featured with our Auto-stake savings options, NFTs and variable products.
Direct fiat on/off ramps as well as TOAD advertising will be forefront for millions of new to crypto users. 

**TOAD Expansion**

**Bridges**

Toad is already partnered cross chain to ERC20 via the “The Crossing”

The Crossing is a ERC20-BSC bridge with PADSwap’s first partner Catoshi. This will allow users to seek the benefits and capabilities of both Blockchains.

Users on ERC20 can cross the bridge for a nominal fee and benefit from the low gas, staking, farming, yield, and all features that are available on the Binance Smart Chain. 

Users can also cross the bridge to ERC20 to speculate markets and currencies for the same nominal fee.
